Another KVM
===============

This is another KVM-like kernel module in drivers/staging/akvm to run the VM
with INTEL VMX. It can run with the own device model and guest. No much MSRs
supporting now because they're mostly ad-hoc(of cause some are supported by VMX)
and not that necessary for a guest now just focus on mode switching & memory
management, I plan to support more MSRs later when my guest OS start to use
them. Exception injection is supported, APICv based interrupt injection is WIP.

The device model works with this:

The guest kernel works with this(no BIOS, or you can call it BIOS LOL~):
https://github.com/kakashir/akvm_guest/tree/public_version

I play this on my 13th Gen Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-1335U based HP laptop with
6.10 tree + my force-cpumask feature (see https://github.com/kakashir/akvm/tree/force_cpumask_last).

Linux kernel
============

There are several guides for kernel developers and users. These guides can
be rendered in a number of formats, like HTML and PDF. Please read
Documentation/admin-guide/README.rst first.

In order to build the documentation, use ``make htmldocs`` or
``make pdfdocs``.  The formatted documentation can also be read online at:

    https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/

There are various text files in the Documentation/ subdirectory,
several of them using the reStructuredText markup notation.

Please read the Documentation/process/changes.rst file, as it contains the
requirements for building and running the kernel, and information about
the problems which may result by upgrading your kernel.
